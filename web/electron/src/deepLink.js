// from open-url / second-instance / argv, the queue, and the orchestrator
// that acts on these decisions); see README "Deep links".
//
// An `omnigent://<hostname>/c/<session_id>` URL names a server by host (with
// port if non-default) and a conversation by the SPA's own `/c/:id` route.
// The link carries no http/https scheme — we infer it with the SAME rule the
// setup page uses (defaultSchemeFor: http for loopback, https for remote),
// so a deep link and a pasted URL can never disagree on scheme. The
// workspace mount (`/ml/omnigents`) is deliberately NOT in the link: it is
// server-determined and discovered by expandDatabricksWorkspaceUrl, exactly
// as for a pasted workspace URL.

/**
 * Decide how to open a deep link given a snapshot of the live windows and
 * the set of servers the user has previously trusted.
 *
 * The decision is the careful half of deep-link handling: a deep link is an
 * "open THIS on THAT server" intent, so we prefer reusing a window already
 * on that server (no second window, no dropped stream); fall back to
 * opening a new window on a server the user already chose; and require
 * explicit consent only for a server the user has NEVER connected to —
 * because pinning a new origin is a privilege grant (notifications, badge,
 * mic), and a clicked link must not silently pin an attacker-chosen origin.
 *
 * Each window snapshot carries:
 *   - `origin`: the origin the window is PINNED to (null = setup page);
 *   - `currentOrigin`: origin of the window's top-level page RIGHT NOW
 *     (may differ from `origin` mid-SSO redirect on a foreign IdP page).
 *
 * @param {Object} state
 * @param {string} state.targetOrigin The deep link's server origin.
 * @param {{origin: string | null, currentOrigin: string | null}[]} state.windows
 *   Live shell windows, in creation order.
 * @param {string[]} state.knownOrigins Origins the user previously connected
 *   to (origins of `recent_servers` ∪ {saved `server_url`}).
 * @param {number | null} [state.focusedIndex] Index into `windows` of the
 *   currently focused shell window, if any (preferred when several windows
 *   are pinned to the target origin).
 * @returns {{ strategy: "reuse-inplace", windowIndex: number }
