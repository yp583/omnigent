"""Tests for omnigent.repl._repl helpers.

Covers pure parsing helpers used by the Ctrl+O debug overlay. The
overlay fetches items from the conversation store and walks
function_call_output rows looking for sys_session_send handles; the
parsing logic under test here is the seam that decides whether a
given output is a sub-agent spawn (and therefore deserves a sidebar
tab) or an unrelated tool result to skip.

async def test_list_all_conversation_items_paginates_past_100(
    monkeypatch: pytest.MonkeyPatch,
) -> None:
    """
    ``_list_all_conversation_items`` fetches every item across
    ALL pages, not just the first 100 the server returns per
    request.

    Reproduces the user-reported 2026-04-30 "17 of 20 terminals
    in Ctrl+O sidebar" symptom: with only 17 of 20 sys_terminal_launch
    function_call_outputs falling into positions 0..99, the
    sidebar enumerator (single 100-item fetch) missed the last
    three terminals' launch outputs at positions 101, 103, 105
    even though the terminals were verifiably alive.

    What this proves and what a failure means:

    - When the server returns full pages of 100 items, the helper
      keeps paginating with ``after=<last_item_id>`` until it
      hits a short page or empty response. If the helper bails
      after the first page, the test's 217-item fixture surfaces
      only 100 items and the sub-100-cap symptom is back.
    - Pages stitch together in chronological (asc) order — a
      regression that re-orders pages would shuffle the
      reconstructed terminal list and produce nonsensical
      sidebar output.
    - The cursor is the last item's ``id``, not its position or
      timestamp — a fix that mistakenly cursors on
      ``created_at`` would send identical cursor values for
      items appended in the same second and infinite-loop OR
      drop items.

    On revert (drop the ``while`` loop, replace with a single
    ``list_items(limit=100)`` call): the assertion ``len(items)
    == total`` fails with ``100 != 217``.

    Run :class:`_SlashCommandCompleter` against *text* and return
    a flat list of ``(text, display_meta, start_position)`` tuples.

    Each entry captures everything a downstream test cares about:
    the completion text inserted into the buffer, the help string
    rendered next to the menu row, and the start_position used to
    splice the completion into place. Returning a flat list (rather
    than the :class:`Completion` instances themselves) keeps the
    assertions exact-match-friendly without leaking prompt-toolkit
    internals into every test.

        the next character"). Pass ``""`` to test the empty
        buffer, ``"/h"`` to test prefix filtering, etc.
