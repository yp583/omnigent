"""Tests for the runner's
``WS /v1/sessions/{id}/resources/terminals/{terminal_id}/attach`` endpoint.

The endpoint resolves the opaque terminal resource id back to the
runner-local registry entry and bridges PTY bytes to the
browser-facing WebSocket via ``tmux attach``. These tests pin the
route boundary and registry lookup; the actual PTY bridge is
exercised by stubbing the bridge spawn boundary or PTY fd (the
bridge logic itself is unit-tested elsewhere via the shared helper).
