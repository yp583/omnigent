    """
    A parent idling with a stuck wake flag but an EMPTY inbox clears the flag.

    Companion to ``test_parent_idle_with_stuck_wake_flag_posts_recovery_wake``,
    which covers the stuck-flag + *non-empty* inbox case (re-arm a recovery
    wake). This guards the sibling variant the reviewer flagged:
    the parent consumes a mid-turn wake as an injection AND drains
    ``sys_read_inbox`` in that *same* live turn, so the turn ends with the
    debounce flag still set (turn start is the only place it clears) but the
    inbox already emptied. The buggy helper returned early on
    ``inbox.empty()`` WITHOUT discarding the flag, so the flag stayed stuck
    forever — and the NEXT child completion was debounced and stranded. The
    fix (``_rewake_parent_if_inbox_stranded``) discards the flag on idle
    *regardless* of inbox state, posting a recovery wake only when results
    remain.

    The closure-local ``_subagent_wake_pending`` set lives inside
    ``create_runner_app`` and has no module-level ref (unlike
    ``_session_inboxes_ref``), so the flag-clear is asserted *behaviorally* —
    which is also the stronger, user-facing claim: a subsequent child
    completion WAKES the parent (fresh POST) instead of being silently
    debounced. A stuck flag would suppress that wake, which is exactly the
    stranding the fix prevents. This is the discriminator: it goes red on the
    buggy ``inbox.empty()``-returns-without-discard ordering and green on the
    fix.

    Sequence (wake counts bracketed): (1) child A completes idle → wake [1],
    parent turn starts (clears flag); (2) child B completes mid-turn → wake
    [2], re-arms flag (A's + B's results now both queued); (3) the test drains
    the inbox to EMPTY in-turn (mirrors the parent draining via
    ``sys_read_inbox`` during its live turn) — flag stays set; (4) the turn
    ends idle → helper discards the stuck flag and, because the inbox is
    empty, posts NO recovery wake (count stays [2]); (5) child C completes
    post-idle → because the flag was cleared, C is NOT debounced and posts a
    fresh wake [3]. Under the bug, step 4 leaves the flag set, so step 5's C
    is debounced (count stays [2]) and C's result strands.

    The interrupt handler's whole job is the Escape keystroke. This test
    pins the three properties of that handler:

    1. ``inject_interrupt`` is called with the bridge dir derived from
       the conversation id (the Escape keystroke that actually stops
       Claude).
    2. NO ``[System: interrupted]`` marker is appended to the runner's
       in-memory ``_session_histories``. That synthetic marker is for
       in-process LLM harnesses, where the runner's history is the
       model's next-turn context; Claude-native owns its own session and
       records the interrupt in its own (forwarder-mirrored) transcript,
       so persisting a forged ``role:"user"`` marker only diverged the
       AP-side mirror from Claude's real transcript.
    3. NO ``session.status: idle`` is enqueued: idle on interrupt now
       comes solely from the terminal's PTY-activity watcher (it sees
       the pane quiesce after the Escape), which also keeps the session
       ``running`` if the interrupt didn't take. Synthesizing idle here
       would bypass the watcher's running/idle dedupe and could strand
       the UI on idle.

    If side effect 1 is missing, the Escape never lands and Claude keeps
    generating; if a marker reappears in 2, the holdover that forged the
    user bubble is back; if a synthesized idle reappears in 3, the
    watcher desync bug is back.
