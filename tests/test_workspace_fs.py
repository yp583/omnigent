"""Tests for :mod:`omnigent.workspace_fs`.

The :class:`WorkspaceReader` serves the web file panel (browse, changed
files, diffs, search, file content) directly from disk when a session's
runner is offline but its host still holds the workspace. These tests
cover the four ops plus the read-only path-confinement guarantee, using a
real temp directory (and a real git repo for the change-tracking ops) so
the subprocess/os codepaths are exercised end to end.
