"""
Integration tests for git worktree creation on the dedicated per-session
bind endpoint ``POST /v1/hosts/{host_id}/runners`` (``launch_runner``).

This is the endpoint the fork-resume flow uses to bind an already-existing
(unbound) session to a host + directory. Unlike ``POST /v1/sessions`` —
which creates the worktree before the conversation row exists —
``launch_runner`` operates on a row that already exists, so it must create
the worktree at bind time and roll it back if the bind/launch fails.

Drives the endpoint through the full app and a fake host that auto-replies
to the host control frames (``host.stat`` for workspace validation,
``host.create_worktree``, ``host.launch_runner``, and
``host.remove_worktree`` for rollback). See designs/SESSION_GIT_WORKTREE.md.
