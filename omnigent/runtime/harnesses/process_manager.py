"""
Per-conversation harness runtime lifecycle.

Owns the contract from §Process management of
``designs/SERVER_HARNESS_CONTRACT.md``: one subprocess per AP
conversation, lazily spawned on the conversation's first
``get_client`` call, lifecycle coupled to the conversation, idle
reaper for abandoned subprocesses, crash detection, and AP-startup
orphan sweep so a previous Omnigent crash doesn't leave runner processes
behind.

Most harnesses run in a :mod:`omnigent.runtime.harnesses._runner`
subprocess. Explicitly safe official adapters may instead run in the owning
runner process behind the same HTTP/SSE contract. Everything
HTTP-shaped is in :mod:`omnigent.server.schemas`; everything FastAPI-shaped
is in the per-harness factories.

        ``only_if_idle_cutoff`` (the idle reaper's pass cutoff) makes the
        release conditional: the entry is torn down only if it is still
        idle — untouched since the cutoff and with no turn in flight.
        The check happens under the registry lock, atomically with the
        unregister, so a turn that starts while an earlier entry in the
        same reaper pass tears down can never be killed mid-flight
        (mirrors ``pane_reaper``'s busy re-check immediately before
        teardown).

        Note: ``_spawn_locks[conversation_id]`` is intentionally NOT
        removed here. If we removed it, a concurrent caller already
        holding a reference to the lock could be racing a fresh
        ``_get_spawn_lock`` that would create a new lock object —
        the per-conv serialization invariant requires the SAME lock
        instance for all callers of a given conv_id over the AP
        instance's lifetime. The per-lock memory cost is tiny
        (one ``asyncio.Lock``), bounded by the count of unique
        conversation ids the Omnigent instance has ever spawned for. If
        that bound becomes a real problem, switch to a TTL-based
        lock cache.

        Acquires the per-conversation spawn lock before touching
        ``_entries`` so a ``release`` that arrives while ``get_client``
        is still awaiting readiness cannot return early (no entry yet)
        and then lose to a late registration. Bumps the per-conversation
        release generation under that lock so waiters queued behind this
        release fail instead of respawning after teardown; a fresh
        ``get_client`` started after release samples the new generation
        and may respawn. Lock order is spawn lock then ``_registry_lock``
        — never the reverse while holding both — so this cannot deadlock

        Background task: periodically reap idle subprocesses.

        Iterates the registry, releasing any entry whose

        has no in-flight response on the harness. Sleeps for
        ``reaper_interval_s`` between passes. Terminates on

        non-positive ``idle_timeout_s`` (e.g.
        ``OMNIGENT_HARNESS_IDLE_TIMEOUT_S=0``) disables reaping — each
        pass is a no-op.

        Two safety guards beyond raw ``last_used_at`` checks:

        1. **In-flight skip** — entries with an active
           harness ``response_id`` (set when the harness
           emits ``response.created``, cleared on the
           terminal event) are never reaped. ``last_used_at``
           is updated only by :meth:`get_client`, which is
           called ONCE per turn at the start. During a
           long-running streaming response (e.g. a 20-shell
           parallel-tool turn) the entry's ``last_used_at``
           stays frozen at the start-of-turn timestamp; if
           wall-clock minus that timestamp ever exceeds
           ``idle_timeout_s`` the reaper would close the
           per-conversation httpx client mid-stream and rip
           the underlying anyio UDS stream out from under
           the active ``aiter_text()``, surfacing as
           ``ReadError(ClosedResourceError())`` on the
           harness's ``response.completed`` await.

        2. **``time.monotonic()`` for the cutoff** rather
           than ``asyncio.get_running_loop().time()`` — see
           the comment on :meth:`get_client`'s
           ``last_used_at`` write. Different event loops use
           different clock sources; ``time.monotonic()`` is
           the single process-wide source both ends of the

    On POSIX this is ``os.kill(pid, 0)``: a process that was killed but not yet

    — callers (the orphan sweep, and tests that SIGKILL a harness then wait on
    this before expecting a respawn) use ``not _pid_alive(pid)`` as a proxy for
    "fully reaped", which is the moment the asyncio child watcher sets the
    subprocess ``returncode`` and ``get_client`` respawns. A psutil probe that
    treats a zombie as already-dead would break that synchronization (the wait
    returns while ``returncode`` is still ``None``).

    ``os.kill(pid, 0)`` cannot be used on Windows — it maps to
    ``TerminateProcess`` and would *kill* the target — so there we fall back to
    the psutil probe. (Windows has no zombies, so the distinction is moot.)
