    The returned regex fully matches a forward-slash-separated relative path

    subset accepted by the VSCode/Cursor "files to include" / "files to
    exclude" boxes:

    - ``*`` matches any run of characters except ``/`` (one path segment).
    - ``**`` matches any run of characters including ``/`` (cross-directory).
    - ``?`` matches a single character except ``/``.
    - ``{a,b,c}`` matches any one of the comma-separated alternatives. The
      alternatives are treated *literally* — use ``"*.{js,ts}"`` rather than
      ``"{*.js,*.ts}"``.
    - A pattern containing no ``/`` matches the *basename* at any depth (an
      implicit ``**/`` prefix), so ``"*.ts"`` matches ``"src/a.ts"``.
    - A pattern ending in ``/`` matches that directory and everything below
      it, so ``"build/"`` is treated as ``"build/**"``.

    Every character outside the supported metacharacters is passed through
    ``re.escape``, so a user-supplied pattern can never inject arbitrary
    regex.  ``**`` expands to ``.*`` and ``*`` to ``[^/]*`` — both linear,
    so the result is not vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking.

        Walks the full directory tree via ``os.walk()`` inside the sandbox and
        returns files that satisfy all of the supplied filters:

        - ``exclude`` (highest priority): the file is dropped if its path
          matches any exclude glob. Excluded subtrees are pruned from the
          walk where possible, so a pattern like ``"**/node_modules"`` avoids
          descending into those directories.
        - ``include``: when non-empty, the file is kept only if its path
          matches at least one include glob.
        - ``query``: when non-empty, the file's name or relative path must
          contain ``query`` (case-insensitive substring match).

        Glob patterns use the VSCode/Cursor subset documented on
        :func:`_glob_to_regex` and are matched case-insensitively. Only files
        (not directories) are returned, capped at ``limit`` entries.

        A non-empty ``query`` is required: a whitespace-only query would match
        every file, so the method returns an empty list instead of walking the
        whole tree. ``include`` / ``exclude`` only narrow the query's results.

        :param query: Case-insensitive substring to match against filename
            and relative path, e.g. ``"test.md"``. Whitespace-only strings
            return an empty list immediately without walking the tree.
        :param include: Pre-split, non-blank glob patterns scoping which files
            are returned, e.g. ``["*.ts", "src/**"]``. ``None`` or empty means
            no include filter. Parse query strings with :func:`split_glob_list`
            before calling — this method does not re-split or strip.
        :param exclude: Pre-split, non-blank glob patterns for files to drop,
            e.g. ``["**/node_modules", "*.test.ts"]``. ``None`` or empty means
            no exclude filter.
        :param limit: Maximum number of results to return, e.g. ``500``.
        :returns: Flat list of matching filesystem entries, sorted by path (ascending).
        :raises FilesystemPathNotFound: If the root directory is not accessible.
