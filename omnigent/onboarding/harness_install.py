"""Harness CLI install + auth operations — shared by ``run`` and ``configure``.

A coding harness is "ready" along two independent axes:

- **configured** — a usable model credential serves its family (resolved via
  :func:`omnigent.onboarding.provider_config.default_provider_for_harness`
  over the ambient-merged config). That lives in the provider layer.
- **installed** — the harness's CLI binary is on ``PATH``. This module owns
  that axis, mirroring how ``ucode`` checks (``shutil.which(binary)``) and the
  npm packages it installs.

``omni setup --no-internal-beta`` uses this to mark an uninstalled harness and
offer to ``npm install`` it; the first-run ``omnigent run`` flow uses the
same map so the two surfaces never disagree about what the machine can launch.

This module also owns the per-harness **CLI binary name**, so it is the natural
home for driving each harness's own *subscription login/logout* commands
(:func:`harness_login` / :func:`harness_logout`) — letting ``configure
harnesses`` be the single place a user signs in or out of Claude / Codex rather
than running ``codex login`` / ``claude auth login`` by hand.

The "is the CLI logged in?" verdict (:func:`harness_cli_logged_in`) asks the
CLI itself (``claude auth status`` / ``codex login status`` / ``agy models``)
rather than reading a credential file, because the file location is
**platform-specific**
— Claude Code stores its OAuth tokens in the macOS Keychain (not
``~/.claude/.credentials.json``) on macOS, so a file check would falsely report
"not logged in" right after a successful ``claude auth login``. The CLI's own
status command reads wherever it actually stored the credential, so login
verification is correct on every platform. (Ambient detection in
:mod:`omnigent.onboarding.ambient` is file-based and subprocess-free on
Linux; on macOS it reuses :func:`harness_cli_logged_in` as a Keychain fallback
when the credentials file is absent — see ``ambient._claude_login_detected``.)

# approval, forwarder schema) after launching.
# Sources:
# - codex: native policy hook requires >= 0.129.0
#   (`omnigent/codex_native_app_server.py`).
# - pi: non-interactive ``--approve`` override requires >= 0.79.0
#   (``omnigent/pi_native.py``).
# - qwen: ``--input-file`` / ``--json-file`` bridge verified on v0.18.1
#   (``omnigent/qwen_native_forwarder.py`` / ``docs/QWEN_NATIVE_DESIGN.md``).
# - goose: SQLite forwarder schema verified on Goose 1.38.0
#   (``omnigent/goose_native_forwarder.py``).
# - hermes: parent_session_id schema introduced in v0.17.0
#   (``omnigent/hermes_native_forwarder.py``).
# - kiro: MCP config schema (``{"mcpServers": ...}``) verified on kiro-cli 2.10.0
#   (``omnigent/kiro_native_bridge.py``).
# - claude: `--mcp-config` (required by the native bridge) introduced long
#   before 2026-06-01. The first Claude Code release after the cutoff is
#   2.1.161, so use that as the supported floor.
# - codex: native policy hook requires >= 0.129.0, but that shipped before
#   2026-06-01. The first Codex release after the cutoff is 0.137.0. The
#   subagent-router ``PreToolUse`` hook needs 0.145.0, but that is enforced
#   where the hook is registered
#   (``codex_native_app_server._CODEX_ROUTING_HOOK_MIN_VERSION``) so an older
#   CLI loses only smart-routing spawn gating, not the ability to launch.
# - cursor: Cursor's CLI uses ``YYYY.MM.DD[-build]`` date versions. Default
#   to the day after 2026-06-01 so we don't support stale pre-June builds.
# - kimi: the harness drives Moonshot's ``kimi-code`` CLI (the ``kimi`` binary
#   this spec installs), whose releases are a 0.x series — NOT the separate
#   ``kimi-cli`` project, which numbers from 1.x. Its first release after
#   2026-06-01 is 0.7.0.
# - hermes: parent_session_id schema introduced in v0.17.0. Hermes reports a
#   semver version with the build date alongside it
#   (``Hermes Agent v0.19.1 (2026.7.30)``), so the floor is that semver.

    its tokens in the macOS Keychain rather than ``~/.claude/.credentials.json``

    ``login_status_key``: a CLI that publishes a JSON status object names its
    boolean field there (Claude ``loggedIn`` / Cursor ``isAuthenticated``) and
    is read structurally; a CLI with no ``login_status_key`` has no JSON verdict
    (Codex's human line, ``agy models``' model list), so the exit code decides
    (``0`` only when logged in) and stdout is never parsed.

    Positive verdicts are cached for :data:`_LOGIN_PROBE_CACHE_TTL_S`
