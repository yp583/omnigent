"""Harness readiness checks used by the host daemon.

The daemon reports a per-harness readiness map in its hello frame, refreshes
it while connected (so the web agent picker can warn accurately), and
re-checks the session's harness before spawning a runner (so an unconfigured
launch fails clearly instead of dying inside the executor).

Launch gating here is deliberately narrow: the daemon checks binaries for
CLI-wrapping harnesses but does not block on authentication. Picker readiness
is richer where a local signal exists. In particular, ``claude-sdk`` uses its
bundled Claude Code executable and reports ready when either an Omnigent
Anthropic provider entry or the system Claude subscription login is present;
otherwise it reports ``needs-auth`` without requiring a system CLI binary.

Other in-process SDK harnesses resolve credentials at runtime from sources the
daemon cannot enumerate, including a spec's ``executor.auth`` with ``${ENV}``
expansion, so they remain ungated. Unknown harnesses fail open for the same
reason. A genuine unresolved credential still surfaces at the first turn via
the executor's own error.

    Built so the server/web UI can do a plain dict lookup with whatever
    spelling it holds — canonical ids, executor-type spellings, the
    ``claude`` alias, and ``pi``. Most SDK and unknown harnesses map to
    ``True`` (never gated); Claude SDK additionally reports host-level provider
    or subscription readiness. CLI-wrapping harnesses map to their local
    binary/auth signal. Codex entries use a structured string reason when
    unavailable: ``"binary-missing"`` or ``"needs-auth"``.

    :returns: Mapping of harness spelling to readiness, e.g.
        ``{"claude-native": False, "codex-native": "needs-auth",
        "claude-sdk": "needs-auth", "openai-agents": True, "pi": True,
        "qwen": True}``.
