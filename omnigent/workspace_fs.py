"""Process-agnostic, read-only workspace filesystem reader.

The runner serves the web UI's file panel (directory browse, changed
files, diffs, search, file content) by reading its sandboxed
workspace.  When the runner process dies but the host that holds the
workspace on disk is still connected, the host serves the same panel by
running this module against the workspace directory directly.

This reader is deliberately *read-only* and *sandbox-free*: it never
writes, never runs a shell, and confines every path to the workspace
root.  It reuses the runner's pure helpers (glob translation, path
validation, pagination, the git/edit change registry) so the JSON it
returns is byte-identical to the runner's filesystem endpoints — the
server proxy layer and the frontend cannot tell which side answered.

The returned dicts match, one-to-one, the runner endpoints in
``omnigent/runner/app.py``:

- :meth:`WorkspaceReader.list_or_read` → ``_fs_list_or_read``
- :meth:`WorkspaceReader.changes`      → ``list_filesystem_changes``
- :meth:`WorkspaceReader.diff`         → ``read_environment_file_diff``
- :meth:`WorkspaceReader.search`       → ``search_environment_files``

Change-tracking caveat: in a **git** workspace the changed-files list
and diff baselines come from ``git status`` / ``git show`` and are fully
reconstructable from disk, so the host serves them exactly like the
runner.  In a **non-git** workspace the runner tracks changes from the
live agent's tool calls (in-memory), which the host does not have — so
the host returns an empty changed-files list there.  Directory browse,
search, and file content work identically in both modes.
