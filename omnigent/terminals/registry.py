"""Per-AP-process registry of conversation-scoped tmux terminals.

Replaces the legacy OSC 633 / pexpect ``TerminalManagerRegistry``
documented in ``designs/PERSISTENT_TERMINAL_RESEARCH.md``. The legacy
class kept ``dict[conv_id, TerminalManager]`` where ``TerminalManager``
owned ``Shell`` (pexpect-based) instances keyed by ``shell_name``.

Per ``designs/OMNIGENT_TERMINAL_BRIDGE.md`` §4.2, this rewrite swaps to:

- One terminal abstraction (``inner.terminal.TerminalInstance``) for
  the whole project — tmux-based.
- Three-level keying: ``(conversation_id, terminal_name, session_key)``.
  Multiple session keys per terminal name allow independent tmux
  sessions of the same configured terminal (e.g. ``bash:s1`` and
  ``bash:s2`` running in parallel).
- No idle reaper: terminals are explicit-launch only and the LLM is
  expected to ``sys_terminal_close`` when done. Omnigent shutdown still
  closes everything; per-conversation cleanup runs from the workflow's
  finally block.

The registry is constructed once at Omnigent startup
(``omnigent.runtime._globals.init``) and accessed via
``omnigent.runtime.get_terminal_registry()`` from tools and the
workflow.

**Locking.** A ``threading.Lock`` (not ``asyncio.Lock``) protects the
map. Tool invocations run on background threads via
``asyncio.to_thread`` (see ``runtime/workflow.py:1787``); each thread
spins up its own ``asyncio.run`` loop to drive the registry's async
methods. An ``asyncio.Lock`` would be bound to whichever loop created
it and would silently fail to synchronize concurrent invocations from
different threads. The threading lock is held only for short map
mutations (no tmux I/O underneath); slow tmux subprocess calls happen
outside the lock.
