"""Central, dependency-light platform flags and OS-portability helpers.

omnigent grew up on Linux/macOS and bakes a number of POSIX assumptions into
process management, shells, and user identity. This module is the single place
that answers "which OS are we on?" and provides the small portable primitives
that the rest of the package uses instead of branching on :data:`os.name`
ad hoc.

Keep this module import-cheap and free of heavy/optional dependencies: it is
imported very early (and on Windows it must import before any POSIX-only module
would otherwise crash), so it must never pull in ``fcntl``/``termios``/``pty``
or anything platform-specific at module top level.
