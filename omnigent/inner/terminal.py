        Start a daemon thread driving idle/activity edges from the pane.

        path runs ``SysTerminalLaunchTool.invoke`` on a worker thread
        and drives :meth:`launch` via ``asyncio.run`` per call — that
        loop exits the moment ``launch`` returns, so an asyncio task
        started inside it dies. A daemon thread polling tmux via
        ``subprocess.run`` survives across launch / send / read tool
        calls and stops on :meth:`close` (or when the host process
        exits, since it's a daemon).

        most once per *poll_interval_s*, which for the fast claude-native
        watcher (200ms) is up to ~5/sec while a pane redraws continuously.
        ``on_exit`` fires once when the tmux session disappears unexpectedly.
        Any further rate-limiting of activity (e.g. the runner's
        one-pulse-per-second ``session.terminal.activity`` throttle) is
        the caller's responsibility, not this watcher's. At least one

            edge, or ``None`` to skip idle detection. Must not block the
