        context, so a collaborator granted the session gets it.

        Outside it, ``LEVEL_OWNER``, for reads as much as writes. Everything
        past the workspace is the owner's own machine, and the host-scoped
        endpoint that already browses it (``/v1/hosts/{id}/filesystem``,
        behind the workspace picker) is owner-scoped. Anything weaker here
        would make a shared session a way around that check.

        This is the ONLY place the boundary is decided. The runner is handed
        the path and nothing else: it cannot see who is asking, so it does
        not try to — it enforces the sandbox grants, this enforces identity.

        ``ntpath.isabs`` is used deliberately, and on every platform: it is
        true for BOTH a POSIX leading slash (the wire form this API defines)
        and a Windows drive or UNC root. A gate about identity has to fail
        closed on anything that could be absolute *anywhere*, not just on the
        shape the current deployment happens to send — otherwise a
        ``C:\\Users\\...`` path would slip through at the collaborator level
        and be stopped only by the runner rejecting it further down.

        Note this is the AUTHORIZATION predicate, not the wire-format one.
        Deciding how to encode the path for the runner stays
        ``startswith("/")``, because that is a URL question and URLs use ``/``

        User-initiated creates are gated on the agent's terminal
        access: the requested ``terminal`` must be one of the names
        declared in the agent spec's ``terminals:`` block. Native
        harness bootstrap requests (marked ``ensure_native_terminal``
        or ``bridge_inject_dir`` — the ``omnigent claude`` / ``codex``
        wrappers launching the session's own CLI terminal) are exempt:
        they launch undeclared names via the runner's
        synthesize-from-body path and predate the gate. The markers
        are client-controlled, so the exemption is narrowed to the
        exact shape those wrappers send — a registered native terminal
        name with ``session_key`` ``"main"`` — anything else carrying a
        marker still goes through the declared-name gate (it would
        otherwise be an arbitrary-terminal bypass).
