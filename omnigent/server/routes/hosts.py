"""REST API routes for hosts (``/v1/hosts``).

Provides endpoints for listing connected hosts and launching
runners on them. The Web UI uses these to let users pick a host
for a new session and trigger runner spawning.

Per ``designs/DAEMON_API.md``, host registration is persisted in
the ``hosts`` DB table, which is the cross-replica source of
truth for ``status``. The in-memory ``HostRegistry`` is
per-replica and is used here only when a route needs the live
``HostConnection`` on the current replica (e.g. proxying a
``host.list_dir`` frame). The list/get endpoints answer purely
from the DB so a host connected to replica B reads back as
``"online"`` from replica A.
