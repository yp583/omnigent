"""
Persistent store for host registrations.

Hosts are machines connected via ``omnigent host``. The store
tracks which hosts have ever connected, their names, user_ids, and
online/offline status. The ``hosts`` table is the source of truth
for ``GET /v1/hosts`` — all server replicas query it. Live WebSocket
connection state is tracked separately in the in-memory
``HostRegistry`` (one per replica).
