    idle-timeout, server restart, network blip), and the next
    subscription picks up the session on the server side without any
    user-visible impact. Logging those at WARNING level alarms users
    even though nothing is wrong, and confuses the
    transient transport interruption with the genuinely-bad provider

    """Best-effort server version for the header row, with a legacy fallback.

    Tries ``GET /v1/info`` → ``server_version`` first, then falls back to
    the long-standing ``GET /api/version`` → ``version`` endpoint. The
    fallback matters for older servers (e.g. a staging deployment that
    predates ``server_version`` landing in ``/v1/info``): ``/api/version``
    has reported the same installed version for far longer, so the row
    still fills in instead of waiting for that server to redeploy. Both
    return the identical ``importlib.metadata`` version, so the fallback is
    not a different value, just an older surface.

    Routed through the REPL's already-connected :class:`OmnigentClient` so
    the probe carries the SAME auth (bearer / cookie), base URL, and TLS /
    custom-CA configuration the REPL is already using. These endpoints are
    NOT universally unauthed — a hosted deployment (behind OIDC / accounts /
    a Databricks front door) gates them like any other route, so a bare
    credential-less GET would 401 and the version would silently never show
    on exactly the remote servers where the URL row is displayed. Reusing
    the authenticated client makes the probe answer there.

    Because the client's ``httpx.AsyncClient`` is awaited directly (not run
    on a thread), this never blocks the event loop. Each request is bounded
    *per phase* (connect / read / write each 1.0s) so the worst case a
    healthy-but-slow or unreachable server can add to the previously-instant
    banner stays small — the connect phase, the dominant cost for an
    unreachable host, fails within a second (and a dead host fails the first
    request, so the fallback adds no latency there). Any failure —
    unreachable, slow, 401/4xx/5xx, non-JSON, or a server too old to report
    either field — returns ``None`` and the banner simply omits the version
    row. A welcome-banner detail must never block or fail REPL boot, so this
    swallows every error.

    it to this hook. Two paths:

      ``(policy_name, phase)`` pair. Skip all UI, auto-accept.
      Print a short muted line so the transcript records that
      an auto-accept fired — silent auto-acceptance would be
      security-hostile (user forgets they once said "always").
    - Fresh elicitation: render the preview, offer three
      options (``y`` / ``a`` / ``n``), await a future resolved
      by the main input loop.

    under the REPL's active ``prompt_toolkit`` session, any
    direct stdin read fights ``patch_stdout`` and produces

    the main input loop means typing the verdict works
    exactly like typing any other message. See POLICIES.md
    §7 + ``designs/SERVER_HARNESS_CONTRACT.md`` §"Universal
    API additions".

    ``True`` → ``"accept"``, ``False`` → ``"decline"``. The
    REPL's three-way verdict (once / always / refuse) maps to

        Commit in-flight streamed assistant text at a content-block boundary.

        A single turn can contain several assistant text blocks
        interleaved with tool calls. The streaming executor emits the
        prose as ``TextDelta`` events and the tool calls as inline
        ``function_call`` output items, but it emits the
        ``message`` (role=assistant) output item only once, after all
        deltas — never between consecutive text blocks. The formatter's
        paragraph buffer is reset by ``format_message_done`` only at
        that boundary, so when a tool call interrupts streamed prose the
        buffer keeps accumulating across blocks and the live region
        re-renders the whole turn's prose — prefixed with a fresh
        ``◆`` — on every later delta and tool round (the "growing
        preamble" duplication).

        Flushing here commits the in-flight text whenever a concrete
        non-text item is about to render, so the next block starts from
        an empty buffer. Idempotent: a no-op when no deltas have
        streamed since the last commit. Resets ``_saw_text_deltas`` so
        the next block's first delta re-arms it.

    # of the terminal (the host owns the list UI); Enter switches into the
    # selected agent's live session via the ``on_subagent_select`` callback
    # wired below, Esc closes. The tree is fed live by
    # ``_apply_child_session_event`` (direct children) plus the recursive

    # the top and freezes once they dive into a sub-agent, so the whole
    # hierarchy + the way back to main stay correct even if the main session
    # id changes (e.g. a runner rebind reassigns it). The adapter's

      previous conversation's transcript is visible above the
      input prompt and needs to be cleared before re-rendering

      (``--continue`` / ``--resume <id>``; see
      designs/RUN_OMNIGENT_SESSION_RESUMPTION.md) — passes
      ``redraw_screen=False`` because the welcome banner has
      already been drawn by ``run_repl`` and there's nothing
      else on screen to replace.

    Both call sites render the FULL conversation, not a tail —
    truncating to a "preview" lost too much context (tool args,

    Spawn a fresh tmux window that attaches to *target*'s tmux session.

    Bound on the Ctrl+O overlay's ``O`` (attach) and ``R``
    (attach read-only) keybindings. Mirrors the legacy
    non-AP mode F20-overlay shortcuts at
    ``omnigent/inner/cli.py::_open_current_terminal_window``
    so users with muscle memory from the legacy CLI see the
    same behavior under Omnigent mode.

    Four guards short-circuit cleanly without raising — the
    overlay's exception swallow at the host catches anything
    else, but these four are the common failure modes worth
    surfacing as a clear stderr message:

    1. The selected target isn't a terminal (e.g. user pressed
       ``O`` on the ``main`` row). No-op.
    2. Not running inside tmux (``$TMUX`` unset). The
       ``tmux new-window`` command needs a current session to
       attach the new window to, so this would fail. Print a
       hint instead.
    3. The terminal vanished from the conversation between
       sidebar build and key press. Print a "no longer live"
       message.
    4. The agent's tmux session is dead at runtime (user
       previously attached and exited the bash shell, killing
       the pane → window → session → tmux server). The walker
       still reports the terminal as live because no
       ``sys_terminal_close`` was recorded — the agent didn't
       initiate the teardown. Without this guard, the second
       ``O`` press silently fails: ``tmux new-window`` opens a
       window whose ``tmux attach`` immediately errors and
       closes, looking like a dead key. ``tmux has-session``
       against the recovered socket catches it and prints a
       hint that the agent needs to relaunch.

    On success, the user's tmux client gets a new window
    showing the agent's tmux session. ``-r`` flag adds
    read-only mode; without it both the user and the agent
    can type into the same pane.

    :param target: The selected :class:`OverlayTarget`.
    :param client: Omnigent HTTP client — used to re-walk the
        owning conversation's items so we recover the latest
        socket path (the sidebar's encoded key intentionally
        omits it; see ``_terminal_target_key``).

    Assemble the Ctrl+O debug overview for the REPL.

    The overview intentionally mirrors the ``omnigent run``
    debug panel: a "Session: main" header with session id /
    agent / response / conversation metadata, followed by an
    indexed event stream where every conversation item is
    printed as ``[N] type=...`` with its fields on the
    following indented lines. This keeps the two CLIs visually
    consistent when comparing behavior across harnesses.

    Sections (in order):

    1. **Session header** — ``Session: main``, Session ID
       (conversation id), Agent, Model, Response, Messages
       count. Matches :func:`_render_overview_session_text`
       in ``omnigent/cli.py``.
    2. **Event stream** — all items from the conversation,
       paginated via :func:`_list_all_conversation_items`,
       re-rendered via
       :func:`_render_overview_event` into the same
       ``[N] type=...`` shape omnigent uses. Responses API
       items map onto the omnigent event vocabulary as
       follows: ``message`` (user) → ``user_message``;
       ``message`` (assistant) → ``assistant_message``;
       ``function_call`` → ``tool_call_request``;
       ``function_call_output`` → ``tool_call_complete``.
       Reasoning items are shown as ``reasoning``.
    3. **Fallback** — when no conversation exists yet (fresh
       REPL, no turns), a one-liner explaining the state.

    Errors from the ``/v1/sessions`` fetch surface inside
    the overlay as a red line rather than propagating — Ctrl+O is
    a debug surface, not a critical path, and a transient server
    hiccup shouldn't kill the overlay.

    :param client: The omnigent client used for the items fetch.
    :param session: The client ``Session`` tracking
        ``current_response_id``.
    :param agent_name: Registered agent name for the header, e.g.
        ``"coding_supervisor"``.
    :param fmt: The REPL's :class:`RichBlockFormatter` — reused so
        the overview uses the same palette (muted / accent / error
        colors) as the scrollback.
    :param server_log_path: Optional path to the local server log.
    :param event_log_path: Optional path to the JSONL event log.
    :param cli_log_path: Optional path to the always-on CLI
        diagnostics log (``~/.omnigent/logs/cli/cli-*.log``).
