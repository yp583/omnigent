    propagates through the next ``builder`` call (overlays

@dataclass
class Overlay:
    """
    A fullscreen fly-out pane that overlays the pinned prompt.

    Registered on the :class:`TerminalHost` via
    :meth:`TerminalHost.add_overlay` before :meth:`TerminalHost.run`
    is called. When the user presses *trigger*, the host suspends
    the input prompt and swaps in a dedicated prompt-toolkit
    :class:`Application` whose content is whatever ``builder()``
    returns. Pressing any of *close_keys* (or *trigger* again) exits
    the overlay and returns to the input prompt.

    The host does not know anything about the overlay's meaning —
    it just runs ``builder`` to get Rich content, renders it into
    a scrollable buffer, and handles the basic keybindings. Callers
    own the fetching + formatting of the content.

    Two display modes, selected by whether *targets_builder* is
    provided. This is NOT a "dual path / fallback" pattern (see
    the one-correct-path rule) — it's an explicit API choice:
    some overlays genuinely have a single payload (e.g. a help
    screen, a command reference) while others are multi-target
    (e.g. a debug overlay switching between main / sub-agents).
    The mode is selected once at construction time; there is no
    runtime toggle, no flag to disable the sidebar on a
    per-render basis.

    * **Single pane** (``targets_builder is None``): the overlay
      shows only ``builder()``'s result in a scrollable buffer.
    * **Sidebar + content** (``targets_builder`` is supplied):
      the overlay renders a left sidebar listing every target,
      with the selected one highlighted; Tab / Shift-Tab cycle
      the selection and ``builder`` is re-invoked with the
      chosen :class:`OverlayTarget` so the content pane updates.

    :param trigger: Key binding that opens the overlay, e.g.
        ``"c-o"``. Same string syntax prompt-toolkit accepts in
        :meth:`KeyBindings.add`.
    :param builder: Async callable invoked each time the overlay
        is shown (and each time Tab switches the selected
        target). Receives the currently-selected
        :class:`OverlayTarget`, or ``None`` when the overlay has
        no sidebar. Returns either a plain string or a Rich
        renderable. A fresh call on each open guarantees the
        content reflects current state without the host having
        to invalidate caches.

        For multi-line styled content, return
        :class:`rich.console.Group` of one
        :func:`rich.text.Text.from_markup` per line — NOT a
        single :class:`Text` built from a newline-joined string.
        The Group form keeps each line as a discrete renderable
        the host's content-pane line-splitter understands; the
        joined-string form has been reported to render literal
        markup tags as visible text under certain content-pane
        widths and terminal combinations (kasey_uhlenhuth bug
        report 2026-04-28). Either way, the Group form is the
        idiom every shipped overlay builder uses — match it so
        new builders don't have to rediscover the rule by
        reading the reference implementation. Idiomatic shape::

            from rich.console import Group
            from rich.text import Text

            async def my_builder(target):
                lines = [

                    f"  [dim]status[/dim]: ok",
                ]
                return Group(*(Text.from_markup(line) for line in lines))

        See ``omnigent/repl/_repl.py::_build_debug_overview``
        for the full reference implementation.
    :param title: Optional header rendered at the top of the
        pane, e.g. ``"Conversation history"``. ``None``
        suppresses the header entirely (no title bar, no
        separator under it).
    :param close_keys: Key bindings that close the overlay. The
        trigger key itself is always also treated as a close, so
        the hotkey both opens and closes the overlay by default.
    :param close_hint: Override the auto-generated footer hint
        (e.g. ``"esc  q  c-o  close"``). When ``None`` (default),
        the host derives a hint from *close_keys* + *trigger*
        using consistent short-form abbreviations. Set this to
        a literal string when the auto-generated hint is too
        verbose, ambiguous, or doesn't fit the overlay's
        purpose.
    :param targets_builder: Optional async callable that returns
        the list of :class:`OverlayTarget` entries to show in
        the sidebar. Invoked once when the overlay opens. A
        return of ``[]`` or ``None`` suppresses the sidebar,
        falling back to single-pane mode.
    :param sidebar_width: Column width (in characters) for the
        sidebar when *targets_builder* is provided. Default 24
        — matches the omnigent debug panel and fits the
        ``"type:name"`` labels the sub-agent spawn tool
        produces.
    :param actions: Per-target keybindings that act on the
        currently-selected sidebar entry, e.g. an attach
        shortcut on a terminal target. Each entry is an
        :class:`OverlayAction` with a key + label + async
        handler. Empty tuple by default (no per-target

    The Kitty Keyboard Protocol — supported by Kitty, WezTerm,
    Ghostty, recent xterm, and iTerm2 with "Report modifiers
    using CSI u" enabled — encodes keystrokes like Ctrl+C as
    ``\\x1b[3;5u`` instead of the legacy ``\\x03``. Without
    this registration, a user on one of those terminals
    presses Ctrl+C in the REPL and prompt-toolkit silently
    drops the keystroke (no binding matches the unknown
    sequence).

    Ported from the legacy non-AP mode CLI's
    ``omnigent/inner/cli.py:1186-1239`` so behavior is
    consistent across paths. Three groups:

    1. Control characters (``Ctrl+C``, ``Ctrl+D``, etc.) by
       codepoint.
    2. ``Ctrl+<letter>`` by ASCII code of the letter.
    3. Special keys (Escape, Backspace, Delete, ``Ctrl+M``,
       Shift+Enter → ``F20``, focus-in/out markers).

    Idempotent — guarded by :data:`_CSI_U_INSTALLED` so
    repeated :class:`TerminalHost` construction in the same
    process doesn't re-mutate the parser dict.

    Failure modes degrade silently: if prompt-toolkit's

        Defaults to ``"~/.omnigent_history"`` to match the
        legacy ``omnigent run`` CLI's location
        (``omnigent/inner/cli.py:_cli_history_file_path``) so
        users who flip between legacy and Omnigent mode see the same
        ↑ / Ctrl+R recall in both. SDK consumers outside

    :param model_name: Shown in the bottom toolbar.
    :param toolbar_hints: Right-side hint segment of the

        callers can pass the identical list and keep the
        welcome panel and the toolbar in sync. ``None`` falls
        back to a baseline set (``"esc cancel"``,
        ``"ctrl+c exit"``).
    :param window_title: Optional terminal/tab window title set
        on enter (``__aenter__``) and cleared on exit. Mirrors
        the legacy CLI's ``OSC 0`` title set, which lets users
        distinguish multiple concurrent sessions in their
        terminal tab bar. ``None`` (default) leaves the title
        untouched. Best-effort: terminals that don't honor
        ``OSC 0`` (rare) silently ignore the escape; failures
        in :meth:`set_title` are swallowed so a host that can't
        set the title still runs.
    :param completer: Optional prompt-toolkit
        :class:`~prompt_toolkit.completion.Completer` wired into
        the input. When supplied, the popup is live (Tab / arrows
        to select, Enter to accept). ``None`` disables the popup.
        The host stays generic — callers decide what to complete.

        #      remaining space, so real children stay compact.
        #   2. Cap the buffer Window's height to the actual visual
        #      input height so soft-wrapped prompts can expand, but
        #      the composer still stays compact for very long input.
        #   3. Replace the pinned bottom_toolbar with regular Windows
        #      (separator bar + status line) that flow right after
        #      the input.

            Invoked on overlay open, every Tab/Shift-Tab, and on

            runs fresh each time so it sees latest server state;

               again before the async builder returns, the stale

               (no ``invalidate`` → no repaint) when it matches
               the last rendered one. The periodic refresh uses
               this to stay silent when nothing has changed on
               the server side.

            Subtracts the overlay's chrome from the terminal
            height. The chrome rows are added to ``layout_children``
            below — count them in lock-step:

            * 1 row for the title bar (when ``overlay.title`` set).
            * 1 row for the separator under the title (same gate).
            * 1 row for the bottom separator above the footer
              (always present).
            * 1 row for the footer hint (always present).

            Used by :func:`_ensure_selection_visible` and
            :func:`_get_sidebar` to keep the selected target on
            screen as the user tab-navigates a long target list.
            Returns at least 1 even on absurdly small terminals so
            the sidebar always shows at least the selected row.
            Falls back to a reasonable default when ``get_app()``
            isn't available (overlay construction edge cases).

            iteration subtracted only 2, missing the title +
            top-separator pair. The result on a 38-target list
            in a 32-row terminal was the snap-down landing
            selection on what _looked like_ the last row but was
            actually the second-to-last visible row, so the
            user-selected row clipped off the bottom.

        has reached what cursor-up + erase can reach inside the
        viewport. Beyond this threshold, additional streamed lines
        would scroll into the terminal's scrollback buffer, where
        ``replace_streamed_text``'s cursor-up sequence cannot reach
        them — the original cause of the 2026-04-28 duplicate-render
        bug. By refusing to print past the threshold, we guarantee
        every streamed line is still in-viewport at replace time, so
        the markdown render reliably supersedes the streamed text
        with no leftovers.

        Practical effect for users: short responses stream live as
        before. Long responses pause streaming once they fill the
        viewport (the rest of the response renders only when the
        formatter emits the markdown ``StreamReplace``). The trade
        is partial live-streaming feedback for guaranteed
        markdown-rendered final output. The formatter's
        ``_paragraph_buffer`` holds the full text — no content is
        lost from the gating.

        :returns: ``True`` if there's still room in the viewport for
            another streamed line; ``False`` once the line count has
            hit the ceiling.
